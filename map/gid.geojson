I have tripped that light on my bike several times in the past. It just would not trip today. I know how to place my bike over the road sensors to trip the lights. There is no crosswalk there, so I finally had to go south on the sidewalk on the east side of Sabre Springs Pkwy, to get to the nearest crosswalk where I could press a walk button so I could get safely to the other side of the road.  Probably took me a total of 3 or 4 minutes to get across the road.","Problem Category":"Traffic Signal","Problem Category Detail":"Light Out","Problem Description":"","Geolocation (Latitude)":32.96529839,"Geolocation (Longitude)":-117.0899316,"SAP Problem Category":"SIGNALS - Traffic Signals","SAP Problem Code":8312,"SAP Problem Type":"Other Problem","Case Record Type":"Street Division"}}

There are a lot of cars leaving from the east village area (heading east on imperial) to make a left and get onto the 5 north. It used to be there was a decent length of time for a left arrow for those cars and as long as there were cars it would let them have the right of way, eventually switching to an unprotected left turn when traffic in that direction died down. Now, however, maybe three cars at most can make it through on the arrow and then are stuck waiting for oncoming traffic. As the majority of the traffic heads east on imperial and turns left to get onto the freeway (vs heading west and making a right hand turn to get on the freeway), those leaving east village are now stuck in the light cycle multiple times waiting for their turn. It used to work very well and seemed to be more based on sensing if cars were there, not just a timer. Is it possible to put it back to how it used to be to allow cars to get out of there? It's even worse when there's a Padres game.","Problem Category":"Other","Problem Category Detail":"","Problem Description":"","Geolocation (Latitude)":32.70629705,"Geolocation (Longitude)":-117.1468073,"SAP Problem Category":"","SAP Problem Type":"","Case Record Type":"Street Division Closed Case"}}
